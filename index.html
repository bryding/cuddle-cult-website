                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>Camp Cuddle Cult was founded in 2025 by a group of friends who shared a vision of creating a space at Burning Man dedicated to connection, openness, and dance!</p>
                    <p>We're a small group of like-minded individuals developing a vibrant community that welcomes people of all backgrounds who share our values of consent, intimacy, inclusion, and radical self-expression.</p>
                    <p>Our camp is designed as a sanctuary where participants can escape the harsh desert environment and find comfort in human connection or simple relaxation in our communal lounge spaces.</p>
