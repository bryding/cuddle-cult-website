                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>Camp Cuddle Cult was founded in 2025 by a group of friends in the Boulder/Denver area who shared a vision of creating a space at Burning Man dedicated to connection, openness, and dance!</p>
                    <p>We embrace individuals from all walks of life who share our cherished values of enthusiastic consent, meaningful intimacy, radical inclusion, and unfettered self-expression.</p>
                    <p>Our camp serves as a sanctuary where participants can escape the harsh desert environment and find comfort in human connection or simple relaxation in our communal lounge spaces. When night falls, our spectacular dance floor comes alive, illuminated by towering LED flowers that transform the playa darkness into a mesmerizing oasis of light and movement.</p>
